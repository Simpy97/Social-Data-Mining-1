# Social-Data-Mining

 I initiated the process by establishing a local repository in RapidMiner, naming it "Assign1," and ensuring a successful connection test. My objective was to collect tweets related to gaming for subsequent sentiment analysis using the "Twitter Search" operator. I configured the operator parameters, including the query term ("Gaming"), limit (1000 tweets), language (English), and result type ("recent").

While implementing the "Select Attribute" operator, I encountered difficulties, prompting me to troubleshoot by retrieving the entire dataset again. This step allowed me to ensure the availability of the complete dataset before resolving the issue with the attribute selection.

Sequentially, I executed operations such as text replacements, sentiment analysis using the "Extract Sentiments" operator, and the creation of a new attribute based on specific conditions using the "Generate Attribute" operator. The results were subsequently exported to an Excel file using the "Write Excel" operator.

My selection of gaming as the topic was rooted in my longstanding interest in the gaming industry. The exercise aimed to gain insights into public sentiments and trends surrounding gaming. Despite the overall ease of the exercise, challenges arose during sentiment extraction and attribute selection. Overcoming these hurdles, I successfully ran the operators.

This hands-on experience with RapidMiner Studio not only enhanced my understanding of data analysis processes but also sparked further curiosity about exploring additional functionalities within the tool.
